								<h3>Background</h3>
								<p>First performed as a short concept instrumental in 2016 (dubbed “SQUEEZE” by fans), the fully realized song, featuring vocals from frequent collaborator Mozart’s Sister, premiered at SOPHIE’S debut event, Open Beta in October of 2017, and was played at several live shows thereafter.[1]
                                </p><p>
When played live, it is typically accompanied by a backdrop featuring sets of rapidly-flashing images, lyrics, and shots of a CGI SOPHIE body contorted and manipulated into various gelatinous formations. The backdrop was released two months later as the song’s official video.</p>
								<p>“It’s about the emphasized idea that if you’re showing more face, you’re somehow being more real, but of course, there is a flip side to that, where you have false identities or different projections of yourself that you’re able to cultivate through your image."
                                </p><p>
Similar to Ponyboy, Faceshopping was played several times before release, as early as October 2017. A music video for the song was released on February 4th 2018, with the proper release of the single on the 16th of the same month.

Faceshopping was written alongside Cecile Believe. Its lyrics talk about the beauty industry, beauty standards, stereotypes, and image manipulation.</p>
								
								<p>The song's music video features a 3D render of SOPHIE's face and body being distorted in various ways, cut up amongst flashing images and the song's lyrics.</p>
