								<h3>Background</h3>
								<p>SOPHIE left her label Numbers in 2015 after the release of her debut singles compilation, Product. For nearly two years, SOPHIE did not release her any new solo music, focusing on collaborating with artists such as Charli XCX, Vince Staples and MØ. She continued to tour and play live shows around the globe, debuting many tracks that remain unreleased. A few tracks played at shows during this period would end up on her debut record in altered forms.
                                </p><p>
The album campaign started in September 2017, over a month before the announcement and release of the first single. SOPHIE announced that she would be playing an event the following month in Los Angeles; the event was dubbed her “live debut”, though it was unclear at the time exactly what that entailed; SOPHIE had been exclusively playing live sets since at least 2010.
                                </p><p>
Five days before the event was scheduled to take place, on October 19, 2017, SOPHIE surprise-released the album’s debut single, “It’s Okay to Cry”, along with a music video. The single marked her first solo release since Product and was a monumental moment in her career. Not only was it her first release to feature her own vocals and image, but it also marked her coming out as a transgender woman, now living life as Sophie Xeon.
</p><p>
“It’s Okay to Cry” was followed by two more singles, “Ponyboy” and “Faceshopping”, on the 19th of December 2017 and the 16th of February 2018 respectively. The live show was played again in New York and London, with increasingly elaborate costumes and choreography.

Oil Of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides was later nominated for Best Electronic Dance Album at the 61st annual Grammy Awards.
